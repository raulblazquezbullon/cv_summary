# Automatic CV summarizer
Our main goal with this repo is to automatize some data extraction from CVs, in order to parse it to a more structured form of data.

## Target
**Main idea**: extract name, studies, previous jobs, etc. We hope to achieve it using some NLP techniques and **maybe** a free LLM (educational purposes).
